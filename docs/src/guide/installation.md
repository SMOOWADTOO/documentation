# Installation :rocket:

Follow this guide to install the development environment locally.

## macOS :apple:

You need `npm` which you can find guides to install [here](https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x) using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Other than that, it's as simple as:

```bash
# Change directory to root Casafair folder:
$ cd casafair

# install dependencies: Run this on first run.
$ npm install

# Subsequently, to run on localhost:3000, run the below command:
$ npm run dev
```

## Windows

I found it:

You need to download Node.js in your system [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). After that, follow these steps: 

```bash
# Change directory to root Casafair folder:
$ cd casafair

# install dependencies: Run this on first run.
$ npm install

# Subsequently, to run on localhost:3000, run the below command:
$ npm run dev
```
